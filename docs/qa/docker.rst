Docker for QA
=============
The following describes how to get a prebuilt instance of Normandy for
testing. This is not suitable for development.

Prerequisites
-------------
This guide assumes you have already installed and set up the following:

1. Docker_
2. `Postgres 9.4`_

.. _Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
.. _Postgres 9.4: http://www.postgresql.org/

Preparing an environment file
-----------------------------
Normandy gets all of its configuration via environment variables. Docker
has built in support for this pattern. For this set up, we will be using
an environment file to specifiy this configuration, and having Docker
read that file.

Make a file named ``.env``, and put the following in it. We'll go over
how to fill in the blanks next.

.. code-block:: ini

  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>/<db_name>

``<username>`` and ``<password>`` are the details to authenticate with
Postgres. ``<db_name>`` is the name of the database to connect to, and
is usually ``normandy``.

``<host>`` is more complicated. This needs to be something that the
Docker container can use to connect to Postgres. This needs to be the IP
address of the machine running Postgres, on a network that the Docker
can access. This can be figured out by looking at the IP address of the
host on the bridge network device.

The defaults for this are *usually* one of these two values:

Linux with local Postgres
  ``172.17.0.1``

_`Docker Toolbox` with local Postgres (OSX or Windows)
  ``192.168.99.1``

.. _the Docker Toolbox: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/

Configuring Postgres
--------------------

1. Listening on the Docker IP:

  By default Postgres only listens on localhost, and so Docker containers
  won't be able to connect to it. To change this, edit your Postgres config
  (it is in the Postgres data directory, often at
  ``/var/lib/postgres/postgresql.conf`` or similar). There should be a commented
  out line like:

  .. code-block:: ini

    #listen_addresses = 'localhost'

  Uncomment it, and change it to include the host IP address you found above,
  like:

  .. code-block:: ini

    listen_addresses = 'localhost,172.17.0.1'

2. Allowing connections from the Docker subnet:

   Postgres has ACLs per IP, so we'll need to allow connections from the Docker
   network. Edit your Postgres HBA file, ``pg_hba.conf``. It should be in the
   same place as ``postgresql.conf``. Add a line referencing the docker
   network, like this:

   .. code-block:: ini

     host    all             all             172.17.0.0/16           trust

   For Docker Toolbox, use ``192.168.99.0/24``.

Running Normandy
----------------
1. Download and run the Normandy Docker image:

   .. code-block:: bash

     # Initialize the DB
     docker run -it --env-file=.env mozilla/normandy:latest ./manage.py migrate
     # Create a super user
     docker run -t --env-file=.env mozilla/normandy:latest ./manage.py createsuperuser
     # Load inital database data
     docker run -t --env-file=.env mozilla/normandy:latest ./manage.py initial_data
     # Run the web server
     docker run -t -p 8000:8000 --env-file=.env mozilla/normandy:latest

   This process will run until it is manually stopped with Ctrl-c. Open another
   terminal for the remaining steps.

2. Get the IP to connect to:

   For Linux:
     Get the container ID by running:

     .. code-block:: bash

       CID=$(docker ps -q | head -n 1)

     Use the container ID to get the IP address

     .. code-block:: bash

       docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' $CID

   For Docker Machine (OSX or Windows):
     Use the IP address that Docker Machine assigned to the VM:

     .. code-block:: bash

       docker-machine ip

3. Open that IP address in a browser, on port 8000. For example,
   ``http://172.17.0.3:8000/admin/``.

You should now have an instance of Normandy running in a Docker container.
Congratulations!
